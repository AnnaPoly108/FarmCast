🌾 FarmCast — AI Powered Milk Analysis System

FarmCast is an advanced web application designed to assist dairy farmers, milk collection centers, and quality analyzers by predicting:

✔ Milk Price
✔ Milk Quality (Low, Medium, High)
✔ Cow Breed Type (Local / Jersey / Holstein-Friesian / Crossbreed)

Using only four inputs:

SNF (Solid-Not-Fat)

CLR (Corrected Lactometer Reading)

FAT

Temperature

FarmCast leverages Machine Learning models trained on real-world MILMA dairy datasets to deliver accurate predictions instantly.
